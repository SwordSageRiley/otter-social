## Otter Social is a social media app that I am working on to test and further develop full stack skills.
This project is built on Next.JS using vercel for deployment and Postgres for a database. 
Tailwind is also being used to expidite styling during prototyping.

Current working build can be found at https://otter-social.vercel.app/

### End goal for this project is to have an app that functions similarly to twitter or bluesky.
Complete social media app with follows, posts, privacy settings, messaging, etc.
As an end goal, I plan to experiement with image hosting to add image posts to the app.
